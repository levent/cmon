Come on.
I'm bored of installing God
or Bluepill.

I just want a simple command line interface for checking the state of something.

I want to define my expectations in a simple way

  output_from("ruby script/delayed_job status")\
    .should_not_include("no instances running")

I want to be able to execute this simply on the command line
  
  $ cd /path/to/my/project
  $ cmon monitoring/delayed_job.cmon
    
I want to run this on cron, and have IT email me when things go wrong

  # monitor this once an hour
  # and email me if its down
  MAILTO=my.email@example.com
  0 * * * * cd /path/to/my/project && cmon monitoring/delayed_job.cmon
  
And maybe, if it goes wrong, I want it to restart it for me

  0 * * * * cd /path/to/my/project && cmon monitoring/delayed_job.cmon || ruby script/delayed_job restart

cmon (pronounced "come on") is a simple ruby library that defines it own rspec-like api for defining expectations

It says

  - "if there's anything I can rely upon being up all the time, then its crontab"
  - "let's use crontabs built in emailing to enable notifications"
  - "let's return posix exit codes, so we can use bash's logical operators to chain commands, and responses together
